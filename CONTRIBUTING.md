# Contributing to Microsoft Foundry Agentic Workshop

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document explains how to participate effectively.

## Before you start

**Open an issue before submitting a pull request** for anything beyond trivial fixes (typos, broken links).

Opening an issue first lets maintainers confirm the change is in scope, avoids duplicated effort, and ensures your time is well spent.

## Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports** — incorrect lab steps, broken code, outdated screenshots
- **Content improvements** — clearer wording, better examples, missing validation steps
- **New lab content** — new lab modules that extend the existing progression
- **Infrastructure fixes** — Bicep correctness, security, or reliability improvements
- **Documentation** — guides, quickstarts, architecture docs

## Raising an issue

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/PlagueHO/foundry-agentic-workshop/issues) to avoid duplicates.
1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/PlagueHO/foundry-agentic-workshop/issues/new) and fill in as much detail as possible:
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened
   - The lab number and step (if applicable)
   - Your environment (OS, Python version, Azure region)
1. Wait for a maintainer to acknowledge and label the issue before opening a PR.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name (for example, `fix/lab-04-missing-env-var` or `feat/lab-13-observability`).
1. Make your changes following the conventions below.
1. Verify your changes locally:
   - `pnpm run lint:md` — no Markdown lint errors
   - `az bicep lint --file infra/main.bicep` — no Bicep lint errors (if you changed Bicep)
   - `python -m compileall labs scripts shared` — Python compiles cleanly
1. Reference the issue your PR resolves in the PR description (for example, `Closes #42`).
1. Keep PRs focused — one concern per PR. Large or sweeping changes are harder to review and more likely to be rejected.

## Repository conventions

| Area | Convention |
|------|------------|
| Lab structure | Each lab requires `README.md`, `src/starter.py`, and `solution/` |
| Lab README sections | Objectives → Steps → Validation → Troubleshooting |
| Lab numbering | Preserve the `01`–`12` numbering and progression; do not renumber existing labs |
| Python style | Python 3.13, type hints, single-quoted strings, `main` entry point |
| Bicep | Follow [Azure Verified Modules](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/) conventions |
| Markdown | GFM, `markdownlint-cli2` clean, no forced line wraps, `1.` for all ordered list items |
| Secrets | Never commit secrets, tokens, keys, or connection strings |
| Environment variables | Add all new variables to `shared/.env.example` |

## Lab content standards

- Steps must be concrete and numbered so an attendee can follow them without ambiguity.
- Validation sections must describe observable outcomes (commands, UI states, or printed output the attendee can verify).
- Use real, working example prompts — no placeholder text such as "enter some text here".
- Verify technical accuracy against [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/) before adding or changing steps.
