# Facilitator Quickstart

Use this quickstart to deliver the workshop. It is the high-level flow; see the
[Facilitator Guide](./guide-facilitator.md) for pacing, per-lab facilitation, and common
issues.

## Before you teach

1. Clone this repository to your machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PlagueHO/foundry-agentic-workshop.git
   cd foundry-agentic-workshop
   ```

1. Confirm the organizer has provisioned the environment and shared attendee assignments
   (see the [Organizer Quickstart](./quickstart-organizer.md)).
1. Run the labs end to end once on a `foundry-user` test identity so you hit the same
   constraints attendees do.
1. Confirm proctors have the [Proctor Guide](./guide-proctor.md) and the attendee assignment
   list.

## During delivery

1. Open with the [workshop overview](./index.md) and the architecture context.
1. Have attendees complete the [Attendee Quickstart](./quickstart-attendee.md) setup and run `python scripts/health-check.py` before the first lab.
1. Work through labs in order, time-boxing each module. See the [Facilitator Guide](./guide-facilitator.md#suggested-pacing) for pacing guidance.
1. Reveal solutions only after attendees attempt a lab.

## If you run short on time

- Trim depth on the optional labs first; the core agent-building labs take priority.
- Use the `solution/` folder for live demonstrations when a lab cannot be completed independently.
- If attendees are on the default `foundry-user` role, some labs may not be completable independently; demonstrate those live.
