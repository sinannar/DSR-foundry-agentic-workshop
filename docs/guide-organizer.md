This guide covers standing up and tearing down a shared Microsoft Foundry workshop environment:
infrastructure deployment, per-attendee access, validation, and cleanup. For the condensed
checklist, see the [Organizer Quickstart](./quickstart-organizer.md).

## Prerequisites

1. An Azure subscription where you can create resources and assign roles (Owner or User
   Access Administrator on the target resource group).
1. [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
1. [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
1. Python 3.11 or later (the post-provision role assignment runs as a Python hook).
1. [Foundry Model quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/quotas-limits) in your target region for the models the labs use.
1. The Microsoft Entra ID UPN for each attendee and facilitator.

## Typical workshop setup

This section walks through the most common scenario: a handful of standard attendees and one
facilitator. The whole flow takes about five minutes. A single command — `azd provision` —
deploys the Azure resources and assigns all roles; re-run it any time the roster changes.

### 1. Sign in

Authenticate both CLIs against the subscription where you hold Owner or User Access
Administrator rights.

```bash
az login
azd auth login
```

### 2. Create an environment

Create an isolated azd environment to hold your workshop configuration. This also sets the
Azure region and resource group.

```bash
azd env new my-workshop
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION australiaeast
azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP rg-my-workshop
```

### 3. Set your attendee list

`AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST` is the single configuration variable that drives both project creation
and role assignment. Set it to a single-line JSON array of attendees before provisioning.

The example below registers five standard attendees and one facilitator. Each standard
attendee gets a dedicated project named `attendee-01` through `attendee-05`; the facilitator
gets `facilitator-01`.

```bash
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST '[{"upn":"alice@contoso.com"},{"upn":"bob@contoso.com"},{"upn":"carol@contoso.com"},{"upn":"david@contoso.com"},{"upn":"eve@contoso.com"},{"upn":"facilitator@contoso.com","role":"facilitator"}]'
```

The default role for entries without an explicit `role` is `foundry-user` — least privilege,
suitable for labs 00–07. The `facilitator` role grants full account-level access.

> [!TIP]
> Store the formatted version in a local file for readability and paste the single-line form
> into `azd env set`. See [Scenario examples](#scenario-examples) for more roster patterns.

### 4. Provision

```bash
azd provision
```

This deploys all Azure resources, runs the post-provision hook to assign roles, and seeds the
Azure AI Search indexes. Re-run this command any time you change `AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST`,
`AZURE_ATTENDEE_COUNT`, or the project prefix.

> [!NOTE]
> Screenshot placeholder — *the Foundry account and its projects in the Azure portal after
> provisioning.* Alt text: "Azure portal resource group showing the Foundry account and one
> project per attendee."

## Validate and share

After provisioning, confirm the environment is healthy and share connection details with
attendees.

### Confirm projects

```bash
azd env get-value AZURE_ATTENDEE_PROJECT_NAMES
```

Open the [Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) and confirm the projects and model deployments
exist. Optionally sign in as a test attendee to verify the expected capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> Screenshot placeholder — *the project list in the Foundry portal.* Alt text: "Microsoft
> Foundry portal showing one project per attendee."

### Share with attendees

Give each attendee:

* Their `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_NAME` (for example `attendee-01`).
* The shared connection values for `.env`: `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`,
  `FOUNDRY_RESOURCE_NAME`, and `AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_NAME`.

Refer them to the [Attendee Quickstart](./quickstart-attendee.md) for setup instructions.

## Attendee list reference

`AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST` is a single-line JSON array persisted by `azd env set` and read by
both the Bicep deployment (project creation) and the post-provision hook (role assignment).
Set it before provisioning; both consumers derive project names and role scopes from the
same value.

The full JSON schema is at `shared/schemas/attendee-list.schema.json`.

### Fields

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `upn` | Yes | — | Microsoft Entra UPN; resolved to an object ID at provisioning time. |
| `role` | No | `AZURE_ATTENDEE_DEFAULT_ROLE` | Role key — see [Role catalog](#role-catalog). |
| `individualProject` | No | `true` | `true` = dedicated project; `false` = shares the first project in the list. |
| `projectName` | No | `<prefix>-NN` by group position | Explicit project name (lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, 2–64 chars). |

### Scenario examples

**Anonymous projects — headcount only**

Use this when you have a seat count but no UPN list yet. Creates five blank projects with no
role assignments. Switch to a named list once UPNs are available.

```bash
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_COUNT 5
```

When `AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST` is also set, it always takes precedence. Unset it first if you
want to switch back to the anonymous count mode.

---

**Standard attendees**

All attendees receive `foundry-user` (least privilege) and a dedicated `attendee-NN` project.

```json
[
  {"upn":"alice@contoso.com"},
  {"upn":"bob@contoso.com"},
  {"upn":"carol@contoso.com"}
]
```

```bash
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST '[{"upn":"alice@contoso.com"},{"upn":"bob@contoso.com"},{"upn":"carol@contoso.com"}]'
```

---

**Standard attendees with a facilitator**

The facilitator gets `Foundry Owner` at account scope and a `facilitator-01` project. Standard
attendees are unaffected.

```json
[
  {"upn":"alice@contoso.com"},
  {"upn":"bob@contoso.com"},
  {"upn":"carol@contoso.com"},
  {"upn":"facilitator@contoso.com","role":"facilitator"}
]
```

---

**Workshop staff — facilitator, proctor, organizer**

Each staff role receives a project under its own prefix. Attendees and staff are numbered
independently, so `attendee-01`, `facilitator-01`, and `proctor-01` are distinct projects.

```json
[
  {"upn":"alice@contoso.com"},
  {"upn":"bob@contoso.com"},
  {"upn":"facilitator@contoso.com","role":"facilitator"},
  {"upn":"proctor@contoso.com","role":"proctor"},
  {"upn":"organizer@contoso.com","role":"organizer"}
]
```

---

**Mixed privilege levels**

Give specific attendees elevated roles while keeping everyone else on `foundry-user`.

```json
[
  {"upn":"alice@contoso.com"},
  {"upn":"bob@contoso.com","role":"foundry-project-manager"},
  {"upn":"carol@contoso.com","role":"foundry-account-owner"}
]
```

---

**Team projects**

Multiple attendees share a project by specifying the same `projectName`. Duplicates are
removed so only one project is created per unique name.

```json
[
  {"upn":"alice@contoso.com","projectName":"team-red"},
  {"upn":"bob@contoso.com","projectName":"team-red"},
  {"upn":"carol@contoso.com","projectName":"team-blue"},
  {"upn":"david@contoso.com","projectName":"team-blue"}
]
```

---

**Updating an existing roster**

Update `AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST` and re-run `azd provision`. Existing projects are preserved;
new entries get projects and role assignments; role changes are applied.

```json
[
  {"upn":"alice@contoso.com","role":"foundry-project-manager"},
  {"upn":"bob@contoso.com"},
  {"upn":"new-attendee@contoso.com"}
]
```

### Validate before provisioning

Use `check-jsonschema` to catch typos and invalid role keys before provisioning:

```bash
pip install check-jsonschema
azd env get-value AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST > /tmp/attendee-list.json
check-jsonschema --schemafile shared/schemas/attendee-list.schema.json /tmp/attendee-list.json
```

## Role catalog

Role keys map to Foundry built-in roles. See
[Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/concepts/rbac-foundry).

| Role key | Foundry role | Scope | Can | Cannot |
|----------|--------------|-------|-----|--------|
| `foundry-user` | Foundry User | Project | Build agents, create connections, use deployed models, Foundry IQ, toolboxes (labs 00–07). | Deploy models, publish agents. |
| `foundry-project-manager` | Foundry Project Manager | Account | Everything above plus publish agents (lab 08). | Deploy models. |
| `foundry-account-owner` | Foundry Account Owner | Account | Everything above plus deploy models. | — |
| `foundry-owner` | Foundry Owner | Account | Full build and manage. | — |
| `facilitator` | Foundry Owner | Account | Full access under the facilitator project prefix. | — |
| `proctor` | Foundry Owner | Account | Full access under the proctor project prefix. | — |
| `organizer` | Foundry Owner | Account | Full access under the organizer project prefix. | — |

`foundry-user` is the default and is least privilege. Because the organizer pre-deploys models
during provisioning, attendees stay on `foundry-user` for labs 00–07. Elevate only when a lab
requires it.

```bash
# Elevate everyone to deploy models
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_DEFAULT_ROLE foundry-account-owner

# Or elevate individual attendees
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST '[{"upn":"alice@contoso.com","role":"foundry-account-owner"},{"upn":"bob@contoso.com"}]'
```

### Staff project prefixes

Staff roles use their own prefix and are numbered independently of standard attendees. A
`facilitator-01` project is always provisioned by default even when no facilitator appears in
`AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST` (controlled by `AZURE_ENSURE_FACILITATOR_PROJECT`).

| Role | Default prefix | Env var | Example project |
|------|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| Standard attendee | `attendee` | `AZURE_ATTENDEE_PROJECT_PREFIX` | `attendee-01` |
| `facilitator` | `facilitator` | `AZURE_FACILITATOR_PROJECT_PREFIX` | `facilitator-01` |
| `proctor` | `proctor` | `AZURE_PROCTOR_PROJECT_PREFIX` | `proctor-01` |
| `organizer` | `organizer` | `AZURE_ORGANIZER_PROJECT_PREFIX` | `organizer-01` |

Override any prefix with `azd env set <VAR> <value>` before provisioning.

## Provisioning audit

After role assignment, the hook writes a CSV audit file and prints a console summary.

File: `./.azure/attendee-provisioning-<env>-<timestamp>.csv`

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `upn` | Attendee UPN. |
| `object_id` | Resolved Microsoft Entra object ID. |
| `role_key` | Role key requested. |
| `role_display_name` | Foundry role display name. |
| `role_definition_id` | Azure role definition GUID. |
| `project_name` | Target project, or empty for account-scoped roles. |
| `scope` | `project` or `account`. |
| `status` | `succeeded` or `failed`. |
| `message` | Failure detail when status is `failed`. |

Review failed rows before the workshop starts. The most common cause is a UPN that does not
resolve to an object ID (typo or guest account not in the tenant).

## Teardown

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```

This removes the resource group and purges soft-deleted Foundry and Key Vault resources so
the names are immediately reusable.
