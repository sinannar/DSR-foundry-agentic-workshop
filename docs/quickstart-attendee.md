Use this quickstart when your organizer has already provisioned shared workshop
infrastructure. It is the high-level flow; see the [Attendee Guide](./guide-attendee.md) for
detailed setup and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

1. [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
1. [Python 3.11 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
1. Your assigned project information from your organizer.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlagueHO/foundry-agentic-workshop.git
cd foundry-agentic-workshop
```

## Configure your environment file

1. Copy `shared/.env.example` to `.env`.
1. Populate these values from your assignment:
   - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
   - `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`
   - `FOUNDRY_RESOURCE_NAME`
   - `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_NAME`
