"""Hosted acl-remedy-advisor-hosted agent entry point, toolbox edition (Module 10).

This module rebuilds the Module 09 ACL Remedy Advisor as an Agent Framework agent whose
**only** tool is the ``acl-remedy-toolbox`` Foundry Toolbox, then serves it over the Foundry
hosted-agent contract with ``ResponsesHostServer``. Deploying it as a new source-code version
of ``acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code`` swaps the three separately wired tools from Module 09
(the ``retail_remedy_ops`` MCP server, web search, and code interpreter) for a single toolbox
endpoint that bundles all of them behind Tool Search.

How the toolbox is consumed:
  - The toolbox is exposed as an MCP endpoint secured with Microsoft Entra authentication.
    Every request — including the initial MCP handshake — must carry an Entra bearer token
    (scope ``https://ai.azure.com/.default``) and the preview header
    ``Foundry-Features: Toolboxes=V1Preview``.
  - Both are attached at the httpx-client level so they are present on every request, then the
    toolbox endpoint is wrapped in an ``MCPStreamableHTTPTool`` and given to the ``Agent``.
  - Inside the hosted container, ``DefaultAzureCredential`` resolves to the agent's own
    per-deploy Microsoft Entra identity, which holds the Foundry User role — sufficient to
    authenticate to the toolbox endpoint on the same scope it already uses to call the model.

Environment variables (provided by Foundry at runtime, and by your ``.env`` locally):
    FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT        The Foundry project endpoint (injected by Foundry).
    AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME  The chat model deployment name (for example "chat").
    TOOLBOX_NAME                    The toolbox name (default "acl-remedy-toolbox").
