# 10. Foundry Toolboxes

![Diagram showing the Foundry Toolbox architecture — Build and Consume pillars expose a curated set of tools through a single MCP-compatible endpoint consumed by any agent framework.](../../../docs/assets/diagrams/foundry-toolbox.png)

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Preview notice**: Foundry Toolboxes and Tool Search are currently in **public preview**. Steps and portal UI may change as the feature evolves. See [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD028 -->
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This capstone module builds on three earlier modules:
>
> - [Module 06 — Integrate MCP tools](../06-mcp-tools/README.md): you need the `retail_remedy_ops` MCP server URL (`MCP_SERVER_URL`) — the shared Azure Container Apps server, or your own tunnel.
> - [Module 08 — Use Agent Framework for Python](../08-agent-framework-python/README.md): the hosted agent is a Python **Microsoft Agent Framework** app, reusing the client and agent patterns introduced there.
> - [Module 09 — Deploy hosted agents](../09-hosted-agents/README.md): you publish the agent as a hosted agent from **source code**, exactly as in Module 09, Part 2 — this module replaces its tools with the toolbox.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD028 -->
> [!NOTE]
> If you could not complete Module 06, set `MCP_SERVER_URL` to the shared server URL from your organizer (or run and tunnel your own as described in Module 06) before continuing.

## Objectives

- Bundle the **Retail Remedy Operations MCP server**, **Web Search**, and **Code Interpreter** into a single **Foundry Toolbox** managed through the portal.
- Enable **Tool Search** so the toolbox exposes tools by intent rather than returning the full tool list.
- Deploy a **hosted agent** from **source code** — as a new version of the `acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code` agent from Module 09 — whose only tool is the toolbox.
- Invoke the hosted agent from code and confirm it produces a correct Australian Consumer Law remedy using Tool Search behind the toolbox endpoint.
- Inspect the agent in the portal and review its run traces and metrics.

## Concepts

### What is a Foundry Toolbox?

A **Foundry Toolbox** is a centrally managed collection of tools exposed through a single MCP-compatible endpoint. Instead of each agent wiring its own connections, you define the tools once in a toolbox and any agent connects to a single URL.

Key benefits:

| Benefit | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Centralised management** | Rotate credentials, swap servers, or add new tools without redeploying agents |
| **Versioning** | Create a new toolbox version, test it, then promote it to default when ready |
| **Guardrails** | Apply a named RAI content policy to all tool inputs and outputs at the toolbox layer |
| **Discoverability** | Any agent or MCP client in the organisation can reuse the same toolbox endpoint |

### What is Tool Search?

When a toolbox contains many tools, passing all definitions to the model on every turn wastes tokens and dilutes focus. **Tool Search** solves this by replacing the full tool list with two meta-tools:

| Meta-tool | What the model does |
|---|---|
| `tool_search` | Calls with a natural-language description of what it needs; Foundry returns the matching tool definitions |
| `call_tool` | Invokes any tool returned by `tool_search` |

The model never browses a full tool list — it describes intent, discovers the right tools, and calls them. The agent instructions need to tell the model to call `tool_search` when a needed tool is not already visible.

> [!NOTE]
> Tool descriptions drive match quality. A vague or missing description causes poor discovery. Every tool added to the toolbox should have a clear description.

### Why deploy a hosted agent that uses the toolbox?

A toolbox is exposed as an MCP endpoint secured with Microsoft Entra authentication. Every request — including the connection handshake — must carry an Entra bearer token (scope `https://ai.azure.com/.default`) **and** the preview header `Foundry-Features: Toolboxes=V1Preview`. The Foundry portal's prompt-agent builder cannot yet attach a custom header to an MCP connection, so the agent is a small Microsoft Agent Framework app that attaches both itself.

Rather than run that app locally, you **deploy it as a hosted agent from source code** — the same publish flow as [Module 09, Part 2](../09-hosted-agents/README.md). Foundry builds the container, runs it managed, and gives the agent its own per-deploy Microsoft Entra identity. That identity authenticates to the toolbox endpoint, so the deployed agent reaches every tool — the retail MCP server, web search, and code interpreter — through the single toolbox URL with no local process to keep running.

This is the capstone pattern: **one managed agent, one toolbox endpoint, every tool discovered through Tool Search.**

## Steps

### Part 1 — Get the MCP server URL

The toolbox wraps the same `retail_remedy_ops` MCP server from Module 06. You need its public URL (`MCP_SERVER_URL`) to add it to the toolbox.

#### 1. Confirm your MCP server URL

- [ ] Open your `.env` file and confirm `MCP_SERVER_URL` is set to the shared server URL your organizer provided, ending in `/mcp`. For example:

  ```text
  https://ca-mcp-<env>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io/mcp
  ```

- [ ] Save this URL — you will paste it into the toolbox configuration in the next part.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you are running your own MCP server instead of the shared one, make sure it is still running with port 8080 set to **Public**, and use its tunnel URL (ending in `/mcp`) as your `MCP_SERVER_URL`. See [Module 06](../06-mcp-tools/README.md), Part 1.

---

### Part 2 — Create the toolbox in the Foundry portal

> [!NOTE]
> The Toolboxes portal UI is in preview. The exact navigation path at [ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) may differ from the steps below as the portal evolves. If **Toolboxes** is not visible in your portal navigation, use the [code fallback](#code-fallback--create-the-toolbox-with-python) at the end of this part.

#### 2. Navigate to Toolboxes

- [ ] In a browser, navigate to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) and sign in.
- [ ] In the left navigation, click **Build**.
- [ ] Look for a **Toolboxes** entry under **Build** (it may also appear under **Build → Agents → Tools** or **Build → Tools**).
- [ ] Click **Toolboxes** to open the toolbox management view.

  </details>

#### 3. Create a new toolbox

- [ ] Click **+ Create** or **+ New toolbox**.
- [ ] Enter the following details:

  | Field | Value |
  |---|---|
  | Name | `acl-remedy-toolbox` |
  | Description | `Retail Remedy operations tools, web search, and code interpreter for ACCC and ACL guidance` |

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Create toolbox form</summary>

  ![Create toolbox form showing the name acl-remedy-toolbox and a description field for the new toolbox.](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-10/02-toolbox-create-form.png)

  </details>

#### 4. Add the Web Search tool

- [ ] In the tool configuration area, click **+ Add tool**.
- [ ] Select **Web Search** from the tool picker.
- [ ] In the tool **Description** field, enter:

  ```text
  Search the web for ACCC rulings, Australian Consumer Law guidance, and current retail policy information.
  ```

  > This description is used by Tool Search to route queries. Make it specific to what users will ask about.

#### 5. Add the MCP tool

- [ ] Click **+ Add tool** again.
- [ ] Select **MCP** (or **Model Context Protocol** / **Custom MCP**) from the tool picker.
- [ ] Fill in the connection details:

  | Field | Value |
  |---|---|
  | Label / Server name | `retail_remedy_ops` |
  | Server URL | Your `MCP_SERVER_URL` (ending in `/mcp`) |
  | Authentication | None / Anonymous |
  | Description | `Retail Remedy Operations tools for looking up purchases, product profiles, store policies, replacement options, and creating remedy cases.` |

- [ ] Confirm the six MCP tools are discovered from the MCP server: `lookup_purchase`, `get_product_profile`, `search_store_policy`, `find_replacement_options`, `draft_remedy_summary`, `create_remedy_case`.

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: MCP tool added to the toolbox</summary>

  </details>

#### 6. Add the Code Interpreter tool

- [ ] Click **+ Add tool** again.
- [ ] Select **Code Interpreter** from the tool picker.

  > Code Interpreter runs calculations such as pro-rata refund amounts. Including it in the toolbox keeps every capability the app needs behind the single toolbox endpoint.

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Adding Code Interpreter to the toolbox</summary>

  ![Tool picker showing Code Interpreter being added to the acl-remedy-toolbox.](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-10/06-toolbox-add-code-interpreter.png)

  </details>

- [ ] Confirm the toolbox now lists all three tools: **Web Search**, the `retail_remedy_ops` MCP server, and **Code Interpreter**.

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Toolbox with three tools</summary>

  ![Toolbox configuration showing all three tools — Web Search, the retail_remedy_ops MCP server, and Code Interpreter.](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-10/07-toolbox-three-tools.png)

  </details>

#### 7. Enable Tool Search

- [ ] Look for a **Tool search** toggle or checkbox in the toolbox configuration.
- [ ] Enable it.

  > Enabling Tool Search adds the `toolbox_search_preview` configuration to the toolbox version. This hides the individual tools from the initial `tools/list` response and exposes them through `tool_search` instead, keeping the consuming app's active tool context small.

#### 8. Publish the toolbox and set it as the default version

- [ ] Click **Publish** (or **Save** / **Create**).
- [ ] Confirm a toolbox named `acl-remedy-toolbox` is created.
- [ ] Confirm the published version is set as the **default** version. The consumer endpoint resolves `?api-version=v1` to the default version, so this must be set for the app in Part 3 to connect.

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Toolbox published and set as default</summary>

  ![Toolbox list showing acl-remedy-toolbox published with a version marked as the default.](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-10/03-toolbox-published.png)

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Toolbox saved with three tools as the default version</summary>

  ![Toolbox detail confirming acl-remedy-toolbox saved with Web Search, the MCP server, and Code Interpreter as the default version.](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-10/08-toolbox-saved-v3.png)

  </details>

#### 9. Copy the toolbox MCP endpoint

- [ ] After publishing, locate the **Consumer endpoint** URL for `acl-remedy-toolbox`. It has the form:

  ```text
  https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>/toolboxes/acl-remedy-toolbox/mcp?api-version=v1
  ```

  The app in Part 3 builds this URL automatically from `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `TOOLBOX_NAME`, so you do not need to paste it anywhere — but confirm it matches the endpoint shown in the portal.

#### Code fallback — Create the toolbox with Python

> [!TIP]
> If the portal does not expose Toolboxes in your region yet, or you skipped the steps above, run the fallback script to create the toolbox through the Python SDK. `MCP_SERVER_URL` must be set in your `.env` file.
>
> ```bash
> python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/solution/setup_toolbox.py
> ```
>
> The script creates the `acl-remedy-toolbox` toolbox with Web Search, the `retail_remedy_ops` MCP server, Code Interpreter, and Tool Search enabled, then prints the consumer endpoint URL. Set the new version as the default in the portal if it is not already, then continue with Part 3.

---

### Part 3 — Deploy the toolbox-wired agent as a hosted agent

You now deploy a **hosted agent** whose only tool is the toolbox. The agent is a Python **Microsoft Agent Framework** app (as in Module 08) that points its tool at the toolbox's MCP endpoint and supplies the Entra bearer token and the `Foundry-Features: Toolboxes=V1Preview` header on every request. You publish it from **source code** as a new version of the `acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code` agent from Module 09 — Foundry builds and runs it managed, and its per-deploy identity authenticates to the toolbox.

#### 10. Review the agent bundle

- [ ] Open the agent bundle in [`src/agent/`](https://github.com/PlagueHO/foundry-agentic-workshop/tree/main/labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/src/agent) and review how it wires the toolbox into a hosted agent:
  - [`main.py`](https://github.com/PlagueHO/foundry-agentic-workshop/blob/main/labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/src/agent/main.py) builds the toolbox MCP endpoint as `{FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}/toolboxes/{TOOLBOX_NAME}/mcp?api-version=v1`, wraps it in an `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` backed by an `httpx.AsyncClient` that adds the Entra bearer token and the `Foundry-Features` header to every request, builds a `FoundryChatClient` and an `Agent` whose instructions tell the model to call `tool_search` when a needed tool is not already visible, and serves it over the **Responses** protocol with `ResponsesHostServer`.
  - [`agent.yaml`](https://github.com/PlagueHO/foundry-agentic-workshop/blob/main/labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/src/agent/agent.yaml) declares the hosted agent (`acl-remedy-advisor-hosted`), the Responses protocol, the 1 vCPU / 2 GiB shape, and the baked environment variables.
  - [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/PlagueHO/foundry-agentic-workshop/blob/main/labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/src/agent/requirements.txt) and [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/PlagueHO/foundry-agentic-workshop/blob/main/labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/src/agent/Dockerfile) define the runtime Foundry builds remotely.

  > The agent reads `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` from the runtime environment Foundry injects, and `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` and `TOOLBOX_NAME` from the values baked in at deploy time. It carries **no** MCP server URL — every tool now lives behind the toolbox.

#### 11. Activate the environment and sign in

- [ ] Activate the `.venv` virtual environment from the repository root:

  - **Windows (PowerShell):** `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - **macOS / Linux:** `source .venv/bin/activate`

- [ ] Confirm you are signed in with the Azure CLI — the deploy and invoke scripts authenticate with `DefaultAzureCredential`, which relies on your CLI session:

  ```bash
  az login
  ```

#### 12. Confirm the required environment variables

- [ ] Confirm your `.env` file (or `azd env get-values`) sets:

  | Variable | Value |
  |---|---|
  | `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Your Foundry project endpoint |
  | `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Your subscription ID |
  | `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` | Your resource group |
  | `FOUNDRY_RESOURCE_NAME` | Your Foundry account name |
  | `TOOLBOX_NAME` | `acl-remedy-toolbox` |

  > `HOSTED_AGENT_NAME_CODE` defaults to `acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code` and `AGENT_MODEL` defaults to `chat`. Set them in `.env` only if your deployment uses different names.

#### 13. Deploy the agent from source code

- [ ] Run the deploy script from the repository root:

  ```bash
  python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/solution/deploy_hosted_agent_code.py
  ```

- [ ] The script zips `src/agent/`, uploads it, and Foundry builds the container remotely. Wait for it to report the new version as **active** — the remote build takes a few minutes. The script then grants the agent's per-deploy identity the **Foundry User** role so it can call the model and the toolbox.

  > This publishes a **new version** of the `acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code` agent from Module 09 — the toolbox edition — without disturbing the version you deployed there.

#### 14. View the agent in the portal

- [ ] In a browser, navigate to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com), open your project, and select **Agents** in the left navigation.
- [ ] Open `acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code` and confirm the new version is listed and active.

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Hosted agent in the portal</summary>

  ![Foundry portal Agents page showing the acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code agent with its new toolbox-edition version active.](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-10/09-hosted-agent-in-portal.png)

  </details>

#### 15. Invoke the agent from code

- [ ] Run the invoke script from the repository root:

  ```bash
  python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/solution/invoke_hosted_agent.py
  ```

- [ ] The script selects the latest active version, routes 100% of the agent endpoint traffic to it, and runs a two-turn Australian Consumer Law conversation for receipt `R-1007` (a laptop battery that failed about 14 months after a 12-month warranty). The first turn asks the agent to look up the purchase; the second adds that the customer still has the original box and charger.
- [ ] Confirm the printed response:
  - References the customer's purchase and the relevant store policy retrieved through the `retail_remedy_ops` tools.
  - Applies Australian Consumer Law reasoning (a major or minor failure and the appropriate remedy).
  - Includes a calculated figure (such as a pro-rata refund) produced by Code Interpreter.

  > Because Tool Search is enabled, the agent first calls `tool_search` to discover the retail tools, then calls them through `call_tool` — it never receives the full tool list up front. Every tool reaches the agent through the single toolbox endpoint.

#### 16. Review the run traces and metrics

- [ ] Back in the portal, with `acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code` open, select **Traces** (or **Monitoring → Traces**).
- [ ] Open the most recent run and expand the tool calls. Confirm you can see the `tool_search` call followed by the discovered retail, web search, and code interpreter tool calls flowing through the toolbox.

  </details>

- [ ] Select **Monitoring** (or **Metrics**) and confirm the run appears in the request, latency, and token charts.

## Validation

- The `acl-remedy-toolbox` toolbox exists in your Foundry project containing **Web Search**, the `retail_remedy_ops` MCP server, and **Code Interpreter**, with **Tool Search** enabled and a default version set.
- `python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/solution/deploy_hosted_agent_code.py` publishes a new version of `acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code` that reports **active**.
- The new version appears in the portal **Agents** view for `acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code`.
- `python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/10-foundry-toolboxes/solution/invoke_hosted_agent.py` runs to completion and prints a clear remedy recommendation citing store policy and Australian Consumer Law, including a calculated figure (such as a pro-rata refund) from Code Interpreter.
- The portal **Traces** and **Monitoring** views show the run, with tool calls flowing through the toolbox via Tool Search.

## Congratulations 🎉

You packaged your tools for reuse and shipped them as a managed agent. You assembled an `acl-remedy-toolbox` that exposes **Web Search**, the `retail_remedy_ops` MCP server, and **Code Interpreter** through a single Tool Search–enabled endpoint, then deployed a **hosted agent from source code** — a new toolbox-driven version of `acl-remedy-advisor-hosted-code` — whose per-deploy identity reaches every tool through that one endpoint. This is the capstone pattern for sharing curated capabilities across teams and running them in production.

> Operationalize your agent with monitoring, run history, and Agent ID. No need to scroll — jump straight in!

## Troubleshooting

- **Toolboxes not visible in the portal:** This preview feature may not appear in all regions or portal versions. Use the Python SDK fallback script (`solution/setup_toolbox.py`) to create the toolbox, then continue with Part 3.
- **Deploy never reports active / remote build fails:** The remote build takes a few minutes. If it fails, confirm `src/agent/requirements.txt` is valid and that your account can create agent versions in the project. Re-run `deploy_hosted_agent_code.py`.
- **Agent run returns an authentication or 403 error:** The hosted agent authenticates to the toolbox with its own per-deploy identity. The deploy script grants it the **Foundry User** role automatically; if the first invoke fails right after deploy, wait a minute for the role assignment to propagate and retry.
- **`MCP server failed to initialize` / `Cancelled via cancel scope`:** The toolbox endpoint can drop the first connection attempt on a cold start. Re-run the invoke script. If every attempt fails, confirm the toolbox has a default version set and that the MCP server behind it is still running and publicly exposed.
- **Authentication fails:** The deploy and invoke scripts use `DefaultAzureCredential`, which relies on your Azure CLI session. Run `az login` in the terminal to re-authenticate, then retry. Confirm your account has access to the Foundry project.
- **Empty or unhelpful response:** Tool descriptions drive `tool_search` discovery. Confirm the Web Search and MCP tools have clear, specific descriptions in the toolbox definition. Publish a new toolbox version with improved descriptions and set it as the default.
- **MCP tools not discovered during toolbox creation:** Confirm the MCP server is running and the tunnel URL is still publicly accessible. Restart the server and re-expose port 8080 if needed, then re-create the toolbox with the updated URL.
- **Wrong toolbox is used:** The agent resolves the toolbox by `TOOLBOX_NAME` and uses the default version. Confirm `TOOLBOX_NAME=acl-remedy-toolbox` in your `.env` file and that the intended version is set as the default in the portal.
