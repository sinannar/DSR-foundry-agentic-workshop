"""Lab 08 solution — run the Module 07 Prompt Agent with the Microsoft Agent Framework.

This is the completed version of src/starter.py. It connects to the
acl-remedy-advisor Prompt Agent built in Modules 04-07 and runs it from Python
using the Agent Framework's FoundryAgent client, which binds to an agent that
already exists in Foundry — its model, instructions, and tools all live on the
service. You only connect and run.

The first call returns the complete response in one piece; the second streams the
response as it is generated. Both runs appear under the agent's Traces tab in the
Foundry portal, exactly like a playground conversation.

Prerequisites:
  - acl-remedy-advisor exists in your Foundry project. If you did not finish
    Module 07, recreate its end state first:
        python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/08-agent-framework-python/solution/create_knowledge_base_agent.py
  - Sign in with the Azure CLI so DefaultAzureCredential can authenticate:
        az login
  - FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT (and optionally AGENT_NAME / AGENT_VERSION) are set
    in your .env file.

Environment variables (.env):
  FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT   Project endpoint, e.g.
                             https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>
  AGENT_NAME                 Default: acl-remedy-advisor
  AGENT_VERSION              Optional. Leave empty to use the latest published
                             version; set it to pin a specific version.

Usage:
    python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/08-agent-framework-python/solution/run_prompt_agent.py
