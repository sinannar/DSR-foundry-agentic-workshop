"""Lab 08 starter — run the Module 07 Prompt Agent with the Microsoft Agent Framework.

Fill in each numbered TODO with the matching code snippet from the lab README.
When every TODO is complete, this script connects to the acl-remedy-advisor
Prompt Agent you built in Modules 04-07 and runs it from Python — first as a
single response, then as a streamed response.

Prerequisites:
  - acl-remedy-advisor exists in your Foundry project. If you did not finish
    Module 07, recreate its end state from the solution folder first:
        python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/08-agent-framework-python/solution/create_knowledge_base_agent.py
  - Sign in with the Azure CLI so DefaultAzureCredential can authenticate:
        az login
  - FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT (and optionally AGENT_NAME / AGENT_VERSION) are set
    in your .env file.

Usage:
    python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/08-agent-framework-python/src/starter.py
