- Inspect per-agent operations on the **Traces** and **Monitor** tabs for both the `acl-remedy-advisor` prompt agent and your hosted agent.
- Understand why **continuous evaluation** and **red team** scans matter, and where they are configured.
- Use the **Operate** control plane to monitor agents across your project.
- Open the **Agents** view in Application Insights to see agent telemetry in Azure Monitor.
- *(Extra credit)* Configure continuous evaluation, scheduled evaluations, and scheduled red teaming from the **Monitor** settings.

## Key concepts

### Agent identity and the agent identity blueprint

An **agent identity** is a specialized identity type in [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/what-is-entra) designed specifically for AI agents. It is a special service principal that represents the agent at runtime, with stable identifiers (object ID and app ID) that you can use for authentication and authorization decisions. Agent identities have no credentials of their own.

An **agent identity blueprint** is the Entra ID object that governs a class of agent identities and holds the OAuth credentials (federated identity credentials, certificates, or client secrets) used for lifecycle operations and runtime token exchange.

Foundry provisions and manages these for you automatically:

| Stage | Identity behavior |
|---|---|
| Before publishing | All agents in a project share a **default project agent identity** and a default blueprint. This simplifies permission management while you build and test. |
| After publishing | Each published or hosted agent receives a **distinct agent identity blueprint and agent identity**, tied to the agent application resource for isolation and granular access control. |

Agent identities serve two related needs:

1. **Management and governance** — give administrators a consistent way to inventory agents, apply Conditional Access and Identity Protection policies, and audit activity in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. **Tool authentication** — let an agent authenticate to downstream systems (Azure Storage, MCP servers, Agent-to-Agent endpoints) through an automatic OAuth 2.0 token exchange, without embedding secrets in prompts, code, or connection strings. This works in both *attended* (on-behalf-of a user) and *unattended* (application-only) flows.

> Learn more in [Agent identity concepts in Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/agent-identity) and [Governing agent identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/agent-id-governance-overview).

### Agent observability

Foundry gives you three lenses on a running agent:

1. **Traces** — the execution path of each conversation and response (model calls, tool calls, durations, tokens, cost). Trace data flows to the Application Insights resource connected to your project.
1. **Monitor** — a dashboard of operational metrics (token usage, latency, run success rate) plus evaluation and red-team scores over a time range.
1. **Evaluation** — runs evaluators against datasets or sampled traffic to measure quality, safety, and task adherence.

> [!NOTE]
> This module is a guided tour. It reuses the `acl-remedy-advisor` agent from earlier modules and your hosted agent from [Module 09](../09-hosted-agents/README.md). Telemetry requires the project's Application Insights connection (provisioned by the workshop infrastructure) and at least one prior agent run.

## Steps

### Part 1 — Find the agent identity on the Details tab

- [ ] In [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com), confirm the **New Foundry** toggle is on.
- [ ] Select **Build** in the top navigation, then open the `acl-remedy-advisor` agent.
- [ ] Select the **Details** tab (marked **Preview**).
- [ ] Locate the **Entra Agent Identity** for the agent. Note that, because this agent is not yet published, it uses the **shared default project agent identity** described above.
- [ ] Note the associated **agent identity blueprint**. The blueprint is what Foundry authenticates as during the runtime token exchange when the agent calls a tool.
- [ ] Discuss what the identity is used for: governance (inventory, policy, audit) and secret-free tool authentication to downstream services.

  > [!TIP]
  > To see the shared identity values directly, open the Foundry **project** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Overview → JSON View**, and read the `agentIdentity` and `agentIdentityBlueprint` fields. To browse every agent identity in your tenant, go to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) → **Entra ID → Agent ID → All agent identities**.

### Part 2 — Per-agent operations: Traces (Conversations)

- [ ] With `acl-remedy-advisor` still open, select the **Traces** tab.
- [ ] Switch between the **Conversations** and **Responses** sub-tabs:
  - [ ] **Conversations** groups activity by conversation.
  - [ ] **Responses** lists individual model responses.
- [ ] Review the columns: **Conversation ID**, **Trace ID**, **Response ID**, **Status**, **Created at**, **Duration (s)**, **Tokens (In)**, **Tokens (Out)**, **Estimated cost ($)**, **Evaluation**, and **Agent version**.
- [ ] Use the date-range selector (**Last Day**, **7D**, **1M**, **3M**) to scope the view, then select a **Trace ID** to drill into the execution path for that run (model and tool spans, timings, and inputs/outputs).

  > [!NOTE]
  > The Traces grid is populated *"Data generated when Application Insights is enabled."* If the grid is empty, run the agent once from an earlier module and refresh. See [Agent tracing overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/observability/concepts/trace-agent-concept).

### Part 3 — Per-agent operations: Monitor

- [ ] Select the **Monitor** tab.
- [ ] Review the **summary cards** at the top for high-level metrics, then the **charts** below for granular detail across the selected time range.
- [ ] Interpret the key metrics:

  | Metric | What it tells you |
  |---|---|
  | Token usage | Token counts for agent traffic; high usage can indicate verbose prompts or responses. |
  | Latency | Response time per run; sustained latency above ~10s can indicate throttling, complex tool calls, or network issues. |
  | Run success rate | Percentage of runs that complete; below ~95% warrants investigating failed runs. |
  | Evaluation metrics | Scores produced by evaluators running on sampled outputs. |

- [ ] Call out that **continuous evaluation** and **red team** scans are important operational safeguards and can be set up here (the gear icon opens **Monitor settings**). You configure them in the [extra-credit section](#part-7-extra-credit--configure-evaluations-scheduled-evaluations-and-red-teaming) below.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Continuous evaluation provides near real-time quality and safety scores on sampled traffic and links results back to traces for root-cause analysis. Red team scans use the [AI Red Teaming Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/ai-red-teaming-agent) (built on Microsoft's PyRIT framework) to simulate adversarial probing and surface safety risks such as data leakage or prohibited actions.

### Part 4 — Repeat for the hosted agent

> [!NOTE]
> Use the hosted agent you built in [Module 09](../09-hosted-agents/README.md). Its name is **to be confirmed** in this workshop revision; substitute your hosted agent's name wherever this module refers to `<your-hosted-agent>`.

- [ ] Open `<your-hosted-agent>` under **Build → Agents**.
- [ ] On the **Details** tab, locate its **Entra Agent Identity**. Because a hosted agent has its own application resource, it has a **distinct agent identity and blueprint** rather than the shared project identity — confirm this differs from `acl-remedy-advisor`.
- [ ] On the **Traces** tab, review its conversations and responses the same way as in Part 2.
- [ ] On the **Monitor** tab, review its operational metrics and evaluation scores the same way as in Part 3.
- [ ] Note how the distinct identity isolates the hosted agent's permissions, auditability, and telemetry from the in-development agents in the project.

### Part 5 — The Operate control plane

- [ ] Select **Operate** in the top navigation.
- [ ] Review how the Foundry **control plane** aggregates health and metrics across agents in your subscription using their connected Application Insights resources.
- [ ] Note that the control plane covers prompt-based agents, workflows, **hosted agents**, and manually registered custom agents — giving you a single place to monitor a fleet rather than one agent at a time.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Different users may see different agents depending on their access. Learn more in [Monitor agent health and performance across your fleet](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/control-plane/monitoring-across-fleet).

### Part 6 — The Agents view in Application Insights

- [ ] Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the **Application Insights** resource connected to your Foundry project.
- [ ] Under **Investigate**, open the **Agents (details)** view.
- [ ] Explore what this unified view surfaces for AI agents:
  - [ ] Agent performance and run activity.
  - [ ] Token usage and estimated cost.
  - [ ] Errors and failures to troubleshoot.
- [ ] Note that this view consolidates telemetry across sources (Foundry, Copilot Studio, and third-party agents) and is based on [OpenTelemetry Generative AI semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/). Use the **Search** view to inspect individual conversations when full prompt capture is enabled.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Learn more in [Monitor AI agents with Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/agents-view).

### Part 7 (extra credit) — Configure evaluations, scheduled evaluations, and red teaming

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating evaluation and red-team configurations changes project settings and typically requires the **`foundry-project-manager`** role or higher. If you have the `foundry-user` role, read through this part without applying changes, or ask your organizer to elevate your role.

- [ ] Return to the **Monitor** tab for `acl-remedy-advisor` and select the **gear icon** to open **Monitor settings**.
- [ ] Configure the settings that control which charts appear and which evaluations run:

  | Setting | Purpose | Options |
  |---|---|---|
  | Continuous evaluation | Runs evaluators on sampled agent responses in near real time. | Enable/disable, add evaluators, set the sample rate. |
  | Scheduled evaluations (preview) | Runs evaluations on a schedule to validate performance against benchmarks. | Enable/disable, select an evaluation template and run, set a schedule. |
  | Red team scans (preview) | Runs adversarial tests to detect risks such as data leakage or prohibited actions. | Enable/disable, select an evaluation template and run, set a schedule. |
  | Alerts (preview) | Detects performance anomalies, evaluation failures, and security risks. | Configure alerts for latency, token usage, evaluation scores, or red-team findings. |

- [ ] Enable **continuous evaluation**, add one or more evaluators, and set a modest sample rate so the **Monitor** and **Traces** tabs begin showing evaluation scores.
- [ ] Configure a **scheduled evaluation** against a saved evaluation run to track quality over time.
- [ ] Configure a **scheduled red team scan** to probe the agent for safety risks on a recurring basis.

  > [!NOTE]
  > These features can also be configured with the Python SDK. See the [continuous evaluation rule sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects/samples/evaluations/sample_continuous_evaluation_rule.py) and the [scheduled evaluations and red teaming sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects/samples/evaluations/sample_scheduled_evaluations.py), and the dashboard guide [Monitor agents with the Agent Monitoring Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/observability/how-to/how-to-monitor-agents-dashboard).

## Validation

- You can locate the **Entra Agent Identity** and blueprint on the **Details** tab and explain that `acl-remedy-advisor` uses the shared project identity while a hosted agent uses a distinct one.
- You can open **Traces → Conversations** for both agents, read the run columns, and drill into a single trace.
- You can read the **Monitor** dashboard metrics and locate where continuous evaluation and red team scans are configured.
- You can open the **Operate** control plane and the **Agents (details)** view in Application Insights.
- *(Extra credit)* You configured continuous evaluation, a scheduled evaluation, and a scheduled red team scan from **Monitor settings**.

## Congratulations 🎉

You looked at your agents through an operations and identity lens. You found the Entra Agent Identity and blueprint that tie an agent's configuration, runs, and access together, compared the shared project identity to a hosted agent's distinct identity, walked the Traces and Monitor tabs for both agents, toured the Operate control plane and the Application Insights Agents view, and saw where continuous evaluation and red teaming are configured — the foundations of running agents reliably and governing them in production.

> [!TIP]
> **Next up → [Module 12: Publish an agent](../12-publishing-agents/README.md)**
> Publish your agent so consumers can discover and use it. No need to scroll — jump straight in!

## Troubleshooting

- If the **Traces** or **Monitor** views are empty, confirm the agent has been run at least once, expand the time range, and refresh after a few minutes for ingestion delay.
- If you see authorization errors viewing telemetry, confirm your account has read access to the connected Application Insights resource — querying logs requires the [Log Analytics Reader](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access?tabs=portal#log-analytics-reader) role.
- If continuous evaluation results do not appear, confirm the rule is enabled, that agent traffic is flowing, and that the project managed identity has the **Foundry User** role.
- If the **Details** tab or evaluation settings are unavailable, confirm your role grants the required access to the project (`foundry-project-manager` or higher for configuration changes).
- If the hosted agent is missing, complete [Module 09](../09-hosted-agents/README.md) first, then return here.
