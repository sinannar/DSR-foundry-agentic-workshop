# Step 05: Integrate MCP tools

## Objectives

- Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to the prompt-based agent.
- Invoke the tools during agent execution.

## Steps

1. Open the `retail-assistant` agent.
1. Add an MCP tool source to the agent:
   1. Select **Tools** and add an MCP tool connection.
   1. Confirm the tool's available functions are discovered and listed.
1. Update the agent instructions to describe when to call the MCP tool.
1. Run the agent and issue a prompt that should trigger the tool, for example a
   request that requires a live lookup the model cannot answer on its own.
1. Inspect the run and confirm the MCP tool was invoked and its result was used
   in the response.

## Validation

- The MCP tool appears in the agent's tool list with discovered functions.
- A test prompt triggers the tool and the response reflects the tool output.
- The run trace shows the tool invocation.

## Troubleshooting

- If tool functions are not discovered, confirm the MCP server endpoint is
  reachable and the connection is authenticated.
- If the tool is never called, strengthen the agent instructions about when to
  use it, and use a prompt that clearly requires it.
- If invocation fails, review the run trace for the specific tool error.
