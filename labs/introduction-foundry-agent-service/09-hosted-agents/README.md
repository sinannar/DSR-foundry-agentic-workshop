# Step 09: Build and run a hosted agent

## Objectives

- Create a hosted agent in your Foundry project.
- Interact with the hosted agent from Python using the Agent Framework.

## Steps

1. Create a hosted agent in the portal or Foundry Toolkit:
   1. Select the deployed `chat` model.
   1. Provide instructions and attach any tools or knowledge from earlier steps.
1. Note the hosted agent name or identifier.
1. Open `src/starter.py` and set the hosted agent target.
1. Run the starter and confirm it invokes the hosted agent and returns a
   response.
1. Send a follow-up prompt to confirm the hosted agent maintains context.

## Validation

- The hosted agent appears in the Agents list.
- `python src/starter.py` invokes the hosted agent and prints its response.
- A follow-up prompt returns a contextually consistent response.

## Troubleshooting

- If the hosted agent is not found, confirm the agent name and that it is saved
  and available in your project.
- If invocation fails, confirm your role grants access to invoke agents in the
  project.
- If responses ignore tools or knowledge, confirm they are attached to the
  hosted agent configuration.
