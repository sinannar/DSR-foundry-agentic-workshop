"""Shared helpers for deploying and operating the hosted acl-remedy-advisor-hosted agent.

These helpers are used by both deployment scripts (``deploy_hosted_agent_code.py`` and
``deploy_hosted_agent_container.py``) and the invocation script
(``invoke_hosted_agent.py``) so the lab keeps a single source of truth for polling,
version selection, and agent-identity RBAC.
