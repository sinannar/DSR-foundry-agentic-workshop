"""Hosted acl-remedy-advisor-hosted agent entry point (Module 09).

This module builds the ACL Remedy Advisor as an Agent Framework agent and exposes
it over the Foundry hosted-agent contract using ``ResponsesHostServer``. Foundry runs
this container, sends requests to the OpenAI Responses endpoint on port 8088, and
probes ``/readiness`` automatically.

The agent calls the live **Retail Remedy Operations MCP server** from Module 06 over
``MCP_SERVER_URL`` (the same public dev-tunnel endpoint you used there), and also enables
the Foundry hosted **web search** and **code interpreter** tools — matching the tool set of
the ``acl-remedy-advisor`` Prompt Agent from Module 06.

Because the MCP server is anonymous (no auth), the hosted agent needs no extra permissions
to reach it; it only needs outbound network access to the public tunnel URL. The MCP server
must be running and publicly exposed before you deploy or invoke this agent (see Module 06,
Part 2). The dev-tunnel URL is baked into the deploy as an environment variable, so if the
tunnel changes you must redeploy the agent.

Environment variables (provided by Foundry at runtime, and by your ``.env`` locally):
    FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT        The Foundry project endpoint.
    AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME  The chat model deployment name (for example "chat").
    MCP_SERVER_URL                  Public URL of the Retail Remedy Operations MCP server,
                                    ending in ``/mcp`` (from Module 06).
    MCP_SERVER_LABEL                Tool name for the MCP server (default "retail_remedy_ops").
