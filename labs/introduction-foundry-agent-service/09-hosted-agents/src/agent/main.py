"""Hosted acl-remedy-advisor-hosted agent entry point (Module 09).

This module builds the ACL Remedy Advisor as an Agent Framework agent and exposes
it over the Foundry hosted-agent contract using ``ResponsesHostServer``. Foundry runs
this container, sends requests to the OpenAI Responses endpoint on port 8088, and
probes ``/readiness`` automatically.

The six retail tools are bundled in-process (see ``retail_tools.py``), so the agent is
fully self-contained — there is no MCP server to run or dev tunnel to expose.

Environment variables (provided by Foundry at runtime, and by your ``.env`` locally):
    FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT        The Foundry project endpoint.
    AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME  The chat model deployment name (for example "chat").
