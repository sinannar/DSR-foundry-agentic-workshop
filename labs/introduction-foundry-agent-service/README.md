# Introduction to Foundry Agent Service

This Lab covers the full end-to-end journey for building and shipping agentic solutions with Microsoft Foundry.

In this Lab, you will learn how to:

1. Set up your workshop environment and verify access.
1. Build prompt-based and hosted agents.
1. Orchestrate tools and multi-agent patterns.
1. Apply Agent Framework patterns in Python.
1. Use Foundry IQ and Toolboxes for richer agent workflows.
1. Prepare agent identity and publishing workflows.

The module pages are generated automatically during docs build and preview from source README files in the lab directories under `labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service`.

| 5 | [Agent Tools and Evaluations](./05-agent-tools-and-evaluations/README.md) | 30 min | ✅ | `acl-remedy-advisor` extended with tools plus an evaluation run. |
| 6 | [MCP Tools](./06-mcp-tools/README.md) | 30 min | ✅ | A running `retail_remedy_ops` MCP server wired into the agent. |
| 7 | [Foundry IQ](./07-foundry-iq/README.md) | 25 min | ✅ | A Foundry IQ knowledge base grounding the agent's answers. |
| 8 | [Agent Framework Python](./08-agent-framework-python/README.md) | 25 min | ✅ | A Python Agent Framework app driving the agent. |
| 9 | [Hosted Agents (Planned)](./09-hosted-agents/README.md) | TBD | ✅ | A hosted agent deployed in your Foundry project. |
| 10 | [Foundry Toolboxes (Incomplete)](./10-foundry-toolboxes/README.md) | 30 min | ✅ | An `acl-remedy-toolbox` consumed from a Python Agent Framework app. |
| 11 | [Agent Ops and Agent ID (Planned)](./11-agent-ops-and-agent-id/README.md) | TBD | | Agent identity and operational monitoring configured. |
| 12 | [Publishing Agents (Planned)](./12-publishing-agents/README.md) | TBD | | A published agent ready for consumers. |

Total time: ~3-4 hours, depending on how many modules you complete and your familiarity with the concepts. Each module builds on the previous ones, so we recommend following them in order.

However, if you are short on time or want to jump to a specific topic, you can pick and choose modules. Many of the modules include scripts in the `solution` folder that set up the end state of that module, so you can start from there if you don't have time to complete the earlier modules.
