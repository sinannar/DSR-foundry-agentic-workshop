## Objectives

- Understand what a Prompt Agent is and how the Agent Loop works.
- Create a Prompt Agent using the **Agent Builder** in the Foundry Toolkit for VS Code.
- Chat with the agent from Python code using `AIProjectClient`.

## Concepts

### What is a Prompt Agent?

A **Prompt Agent** is a fully managed agent you configure with three things: a model, a set of instructions, and optional tools. There is no code to write or maintain — Foundry Agent Service handles the runtime for you.

### The Agent Loop

Every agent runs a loop: it receives your message, reasons about it, optionally calls tools to gather information, then generates a response. This cycle repeats for each turn of the conversation.

You can implement this loop yourself — write code that calls a model, parses any tool-call requests from the response, runs the tools, and feeds the results back to the model. That gives you full control but requires code to maintain.

With a **Prompt Agent**, Foundry Agent Service hosts the loop for you. You send a message and receive a finished response. The service handles tool calls, context management, and retries on your behalf.

> **Module 09** introduces the **Microsoft Agent Framework**, which gives you the control of a code-implemented loop while providing structured patterns for complex, multi-agent workflows. For now, you'll use `AIProjectClient` — the simplest path for interacting with a Prompt Agent from code.

### Agent Builder vs code creation

There are two ways to create a Prompt Agent:

| Approach | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Agent Builder** (this module) | Quick creation, visual configuration, playground testing — no code required |
| **SDK (`PromptAgentDefinition`)** | Programmatic creation, CI/CD pipelines, version-controlled agent definitions |

Both produce the same agent. This module uses Agent Builder so you can see the configuration visually before writing any code.

## Steps

### Part 1 — Create the Prompt Agent in Agent Builder

#### 1. Open Agent Builder

- [ ] Click the **Foundry Toolkit** icon in the Activity Bar.
- [ ] In the **Developer Tools** section, click **Create Agent**.

  ![Foundry Toolkit Developer Tools section showing the Create Agent option leading to Agent Builder](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/04-agent-builder-new.png)

- [ ] On the Create Agent screen, click **Open Agent Builder** under *Design an agent without code*.

#### 2. Configure the agent

- [ ] In the **Agent name** field, enter `acl-remedy-advisor`.
- [ ] In the **Model** dropdown, select `chat (via Microsoft Foundry)`.
- [ ] In the **Instructions** field, paste the following:

  ```text
  You are an Australian Consumer Law (ACL) Remedy Advisor for retail staff.
  When a customer reports a problem with a product, help staff determine the
  correct remedy under the ACL consumer guarantees.

  Distinguish between a **major failure** (the customer may choose a refund,
  replacement, or repair) and a **minor failure** (the business may choose to
  repair the product within a reasonable time, or offer a replacement or
  refund).

  When assessing a situation consider:
  - The type of product and its expected lifespan
  - The price paid
  - How long the customer has had the product
  - What a reasonable consumer would expect

  Use web search to ground your guidance in current ACCC guidance at
  accc.gov.au and always cite your sources with links.

  Always state clearly that you provide general guidance, not legal advice,
  and that "no refund" signs are unlawful under the ACL.

  Be concise and practical — retail staff need fast, clear answers in a
  busy store environment.
  ```

#### 3. Add the Web Search tool

- [ ] Scroll down to the **TOOL** section and click **Add Tool**.
- [ ] In the dialog that opens, click the **Configured** tab.
- [ ] Select **Web search** (Built-in · Microsoft Foundry).
- [ ] Click **Add Tools (1)**.

- [ ] Confirm **Web search** appears in the TOOL section of the Agent Builder.

#### 4. Save and test in the playground

- [ ] Click **Save to Foundry**.
- [ ] Once saved, type a test message in the playground at the bottom of the Agent Builder:

  > A customer wants to return a $1,200 TV that stopped working after 18 months. What are their rights under Australian Consumer Law?

- [ ] Send the message and review the response. Confirm the agent:
  - Identifies whether the failure is major or minor.
  - Cites ACCC guidance (accc.gov.au) or a state consumer affairs site.
  - States that its answer is general guidance, not legal advice.

- [ ] Ask a follow-up question to confirm conversation context is preserved:

  > The customer says they just want a refund and don't want a repair. Can the store insist on repairing it first?

### Part 2 — Chat with the agent from code

#### 5. Set up your environment

- [ ] Copy `shared/.env.example` to `.env` in the repository root (if you have not already done so in Module 01).
- [ ] Open `.env` and confirm or set these two values:

  ```env
  FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<your value from the onboarding file>
  AGENT_NAME=acl-remedy-advisor
  ```

- [ ] Install dependencies if needed:

  ```bash
  pip install -r shared/requirements.txt
  ```

#### 6. Run the starter script

- [ ] Open a terminal and run:

  ```bash
  python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/04-prompt-based-agents/src/starter.py
  ```

- [ ] When prompted, type the same question you used in the playground:

  > A customer wants to return a $1,200 TV that stopped working after 18 months. What are their rights under Australian Consumer Law?

- [ ] Review the response in the terminal. You should see a `[web search]` indicator before the answer, followed by the advisor's response with citations.

- [ ] Ask the follow-up question to confirm the conversation remembers the first turn:

  > The customer says they just want a refund and don't want a repair. Can the store insist on repairing it first?

- [ ] Type `exit` to quit.

#### 7. Review the code

Open `src/starter.py` and note these key patterns:

| Code | What it does |
|---|---|
| `AIProjectClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())` | Connects to your Foundry project using your Azure identity |
| `client.get_openai_client()` | Returns an OpenAI-compatible client scoped to the project |
| `openai.conversations.create()` | Creates a conversation thread — all turns share this context |
| `openai.responses.create(conversation=..., extra_body={"agent_reference": ...})` | Sends a message to the agent and receives a response |
| `response.output_text` | The agent's final text response |
| `response.output` items of type `web_search_call` | Tool calls the agent made during this turn |

## Validation

- `acl-remedy-advisor` appears under **Prompt Agents** in the Foundry Toolkit **My Resources** panel.
- The playground response for the TV question cites at least one link from `accc.gov.au` or a state consumer affairs site.
- Running `src/starter.py` prints a conversation ID, shows a `[web search]` indicator, and returns a cited response.
- The follow-up question receives an answer that references the TV from the first question, confirming conversation memory is working.

## Troubleshooting

- **Save to Foundry fails** — confirm your Default Project is set correctly via the Foundry Toolkit **Set Default Project** action in My Resources. If the Codespace cannot reach the endpoint, create the agent from code using `PromptAgentDefinition` — see the solution folder for an example.
- **Web search does not fire** — rephrase your prompt to explicitly request current information, for example: *Search accc.gov.au for the current rules on major failures.*
- **`AIProjectClient` raises an auth error** — run `az login` in the terminal and confirm `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` is set in your `.env` file.
- **Agent not found** — confirm `AGENT_NAME` in `.env` matches exactly (`acl-remedy-advisor` is case-sensitive).
- **Model unavailable** — confirm the `chat` deployment exists in the **Models** section of your project in the Foundry Toolkit.
