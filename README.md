# Microsoft Foundry Agentic Workshop

This repository contains **L200–L400 hands-on labs** for building agentic solutions on [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-foundry) using [Microsoft Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview), [Foundry IQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-iq/overview), and the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/agent-framework).

## Who is this for

- Software engineers, architects, and technical roles building or designing AI solutions in Azure
- Comfortable with Azure basics; mostly new to Microsoft Foundry and agentic development
- Delivered as an instructor-led session (3–4 hours) or completed independently

## Roles

| Role | Required | Responsible for |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Organizer | Yes | Provisions the shared Azure environment, assigns project access, shares connection details, tears down after the workshop |
| Attendee | Yes | Completes the labs using the shared environment the organizer provisions |
| Facilitator | No | Delivers the session, owns pacing and the time-box per lab, coordinates with proctors |
| Proctor | No | Provides 1:1 floor support during delivery so the facilitator can keep teaching |

## Organizer: provision the lab environment

The organizer deploys a shared Foundry account in their Azure subscription and creates one dedicated project per attendee. Attendees receive their project name and shared connection values; no Azure work is required on their side.

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with [Foundry model quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/foundry-models/quotas-limits) in your target region
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- Python 3.11+

### Clone this repo

The first step is to clone this repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/foundry-agentic-workshop.git
cd foundry-agentic-workshop
```

### Prepare

Using Azure Developer CLI and Azure CLI, create a new environment and set the required variables. `AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST` can be set now or later; it's only read during provisioning.

```bash
az login
azd auth login
azd env new my-workshop
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION australiaeast
azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP rg-my-workshop
```

### Assign attendees by UPN

To assign attendees to the lab, set `AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST` before provisioning. Each entry gets a dedicated Foundry project and the specified role. Configure the JSON array as a list of the attendees you want to grant access to, using their user principal names (UPNs). These must all be users in the Entra ID tenant associated with the subscription you're deploying to.

```bash
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST '[{"upn":"alice@contoso.com"},{"upn":"bob@contoso.com"},{"upn":"facilitator@contoso.com","role":"facilitator"}]'
```

> [!NOTE]
> During the provisioning process, the script `scripts/assign-roles.py` reads `AZURE_ATTENDEE_LIST`, and looks up each user in Entra ID and assigns them the specified role to the assigned project and Azure AI Search. The default role is `foundry-user`, which allows them to build agents and use pre-deployed models but not manage resources or access other attendees' projects.

### Provision

```bash
azd provision
```

For more details, see the [Organizer Guide](./docs/guide-organizer.md) for role options, team projects, and the full attendee list schema.

### Share with attendees

After provisioning, give each attendee:

- Their `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_NAME` (for example `attendee-01`)
- The shared values: `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `FOUNDRY_RESOURCE_NAME`, `AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_NAME`

### Cost

Plan for approximately **AUD 50/day** for a sandbox environment, depending on region, SKU, and usage.

### Teardown

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```

Removes the resource group and purges soft-deleted Foundry and Key Vault resources so names are immediately reusable.

## Attendee: set up your environment

Your organizer provisions the Foundry environment before the workshop. You only need a local development environment and the connection values they share with you.

### Option 1: Dev container (recommended)

This repository includes a [dev container](https://containers.dev/) that installs all required tools and VS Code extensions automatically.

1. Open the repository in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
1. When prompted, select **Reopen in Container** (VS Code) or wait for the Codespaces environment to build.
1. The container installs Azure CLI, Azure Developer CLI, Python 3.13, Node.js, and all required VS Code extensions including the [Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio).

### Option 2: GitHub Codespaces

1. Click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main** in the GitHub UI.
1. The codespace builds from the dev container configuration — no local install required.
1. Continue from step 3 of the [Attendee Quickstart](./docs/quickstart-attendee.md).

### Option 3: Local machine

Install the following tools manually:

- [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) with the [Foundry Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)
- [Python 3.11 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)

Then install the shared Python dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r shared/requirements.txt
```

### Configure and validate

1. Copy `shared/.env.example` to `.env` and populate the values your organizer shared.
1. Sign in:

   ```bash
   az login
   az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>
   ```

1. Validate:

   ```bash
   python scripts/health-check.py
   ```

See the [Attendee Quickstart](./docs/quickstart-attendee.md) for the full flow.
