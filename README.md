## Quick start for lab organizers

Use this path when one organizer deploys a shared environment for multiple learners.

1. Sign in to Azure and azd.

```bash
az login
azd auth login
```

1. Select or create an azd environment name.

```bash
azd env new hol-shared
azd env select hol-shared
```

1. Set core deployment variables.

```bash
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION australiaeast
azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP rg-foundry-hol-shared
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_COUNT 20
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_PROJECT_PREFIX attendee
```

1. Optional: set RBAC profile and attendee identities.

```bash
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_ACCESS_PROFILE project-user
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_USER_PRINCIPAL_NAMES '["learner1@contoso.com","learner2@contoso.com"]'
```

Use `project-user` for least-privilege labs (00-07). For publishing scenarios in lab 08, switch to `project-publisher`.

1. Provision infrastructure.

```bash
azd provision
```

1. View project assignments and share each learner's `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_NAME` value.

```bash
azd env get-value AZURE_ATTENDEE_PROJECT_NAMES
```

1. Tear down when the workshop is finished.

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```

## Quick start for learners

Use this path when an organizer has already deployed shared infrastructure.

1. Copy `shared/.env.example` to a local `.env` file and fill in assigned values:
   - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
   - `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`
   - `FOUNDRY_RESOURCE_NAME`
   - `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_NAME`
   - `AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_NAME`

1. Sign in and confirm the correct subscription is active.

```bash
az login
az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>
```

1. Run the environment check.

```bash
python scripts/health-check.py
```

1. Complete `labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/00-setup` first, then progress through labs 01-08 in order.

## Multi-environment model

- Shared environment model: one organizer deploys a shared Foundry account with multiple attendee projects.
- Per-learner environment model: each learner runs `azd env new <name>` with `AZURE_ATTENDEE_COUNT=1`.
- Environments are isolated by azd environment name and resource group naming.

## Cost note

Plan for approximately **AUD 50/day** for a sandbox environment, depending on region, SKU, and usage.

## Reset between runs

Use `azd down --force --purge` to remove workshop resources between deliveries, then redeploy with updated attendee count.

## Why Bicep

We chose Bicep because it is purpose-built for Azure, concise, readable, and first-class with Azure tooling. It gives us safer infrastructure changes with clear module composition, strong resource typing, and predictable deployment behavior in CI/CD.

This workshop also leans on Azure Verified Modules to keep infrastructure patterns consistent, maintainable, and production-aligned.

## Infrastructure deployment (Bicep + azd)

The infrastructure is defined in Bicep using Azure Verified Modules for Foundry account, Azure AI Search, Storage, and supporting services.

### Quick start

```bash
az login
azd auth login
azd env new hol
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION australiaeast
azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP rg-foundry-hol
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_COUNT 20
azd provision
```

### Optional attendee configuration

Set attendee-specific variables in the active azd environment before provisioning:

```bash
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_PROJECT_PREFIX attendee
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_ACCESS_PROFILE project-user
azd env set AZURE_ATTENDEE_USER_PRINCIPAL_NAMES '["learner1@contoso.com","learner2@contoso.com"]'
azd provision
```

### Teardown

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```
