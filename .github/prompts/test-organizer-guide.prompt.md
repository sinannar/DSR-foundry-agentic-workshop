You must test the steps in the #file:docs/guide-organizer.md.

The list of UPNs to use are:

```json
[{"upn":"lab.attendee.1@MngEnvMCAP199525.onmicrosoft.com"},{"upn":"lab.attendee.2@MngEnvMCAP199525.onmicrosoft.com"},{"upn":"lab.attendee.3@MngEnvMCAP199525.onmicrosoft.com"},{"upn":"lab.facilitator.1@MngEnvMCAP199525.onmicrosoft.com","role":"facilitator"},{"upn":"lab.organizer.1@MngEnvMCAP199525.onmicrosoft.com","role":"organizer"},{"upn":"lab.proctor.1@MngEnvMCAP199525.onmicrosoft.com","role":"proctor"}]
```

The Azure Location should be `AustraliaEast`. The default role should be `foundry-project-manager`. The resource group should be `rg-foundry-hol8`. The environment name should be `foundry-hol8`. I have already authenticated to az and azd. The provisioning will take some time.

You must validate that:

1. The AI Search has been populated.
1. The RBAC roles are assigned correctly.
1. The CSV and MD outputs produced by the pre-provision #file:scripts/prepare-attendee-roles.py and post-provision #file:scripts/generate-attendee-onboarding.py are complete and show the correct output and are in the right place (`.azure/<envname>`).
