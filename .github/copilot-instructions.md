## Purpose

See AGENTS.md for repository layout and commands.

Apply these instructions to generated code, Markdown edits, and PRs.

## Security and Safety Rules

- Never commit secrets, tokens, keys, or connection strings.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Keep credentials in environment variables and document only placeholder values.
- Treat shared/.env.example as the source of truth for expected environment variable names.
- Avoid destructive infrastructure guidance in docs unless explicitly requested and clearly labeled.

## Workshop Content Rules

- Preserve numbered lab progression from 00 through 08.
- Keep each lab independently understandable and runnable.
- Align content language with Azure AI Foundry terminology and workflows.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes scoped to one lab or concern.

## Python Authoring Rules

- Use Python 3.11+ syntax.
- Prefer explicit, typed functions for reusable helpers.
- Keep scripts simple and executable, with a clear `main` entry point when applicable.
- Prefer single-quoted Python strings unless escaping makes double quotes clearer.
- Keep output messages actionable, especially for setup and troubleshooting scripts.

## Naming and Structure Rules

- Match existing directory and filename patterns exactly when adding labs or assets.
- For new lab assets, mirror existing parallel structure before introducing new patterns.
- Keep shared helper logic in shared/ and lab-specific logic within the owning lab folder.
- Do not move or rename lab folders unless explicitly requested.

## Markdown Authoring Rules

- Keep instructional writing concise, direct, and step-oriented.
- Use stable headings that work with sequential workshop delivery.
- Keep setup, validation, and troubleshooting sections clearly separated in lab docs.
- Avoid adding session-specific dates or temporary event details outside date-scoped sections.

## Avoid Patterns

- Avoid broad refactors that touch multiple labs without a clear need.
- Avoid introducing framework or language changes that break Python-first workshop flow.
- Avoid introducing conflicting terms for the same Foundry concept across docs.
=======
- Keep workshop content aligned to Azure AI Foundry terminology and workflows.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes that preserve numbered lab progression.

## Markdown linting

All `.md` files are linted with [markdownlint-cli2](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2).

### Running locally

```bash
# Check for issues
npm run lint:md

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:md:fix
```

### VS Code integration

Install the [markdownlint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) (`DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint`) to see lint errors inline as you edit.

### Key rules

Configuration lives in `.markdownlint.json` and `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`. Notable settings:

- **MD013** (line length): disabled — no line length limit.
- **MD024** (duplicate headings): siblings only — duplicate headings allowed if not siblings.
- **MD029** (ordered list style): `one` — all list items use `1.`.
- **MD033** (inline HTML): only `br` and `kbd` are permitted.
- **MD041** (first line heading): disabled — files need not start with a heading.

### CI

The `lint-markdown` workflow runs automatically on push and pull requests that touch `.md` files. Fix all issues before merging.
